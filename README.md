## Introduction
In order for travel enthusiasts to better plan their trips, they have the need to know weather outlooks for multiple cities. The creation of a weather dashboard would be ideal in order to meet their needs. 

## Technologies
This weather dashboard will run in the browser, feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS, and retrieve data from [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities. For persistent data, localStorage will be used. 

## Functionalities

The following image shows a mock-up of what is expected from this weather dashboard application:
