## Introduction
In order for travel enthusiasts to better plan their trips, they have the need to know weather outlooks for multiple cities. The creation of a weather dashboard would be ideal in order to meet their needs. 

## Technologies
This weather dashboard will run in the browser, feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS, and retrieve data from [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities. For persistent data, localStorage will be used. 

## Functionalities
This weather dashboard comes with a built-in form input, allowing users to key in their desired city to search. Searching a city presents users with current and forecasted weather conditions. Current conditions include city name, country code, date, icon representing current weather conditions, current temperature (Â°C), current humidity, current wind speed (km/h) and current UV index. The UV index risk severity levels are as follows:

- Green = Low (0-2)
- Yellow = Moderate (3-5)
- Orange = High (6-7)
- Red = Very High (8-10)
- Purple = Extreme (11+)

Below the current weather conditions, are a five-day forecast displaying the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity.

Clicking on a city in the search history will present you with current and future conditions for that city. Search history is stored in localStorage. 

A clear all button allows for the user to clear their search history (and their localStorage), also causing the page to refresh, looking brand new.

The following image shows a mock-up of what is expected from this weather dashboard application:
